						<td width="81%">1. The accounts, activities, items, games and models are for you to 
							play with while on the site. Except as permitted by the functionality of this

							You can display our pictures on your own personal web pages for your personal 
							noncommercial use ONLY as long as you write either "Copyright 2005 ROBLOX 
							Corporation All Rights Reserved. Used With Permission" or "(c) 2005 ROBLOX, 
							Inc. All Rights Reserved. Used With Permission" on EVERY page with our pictures 
							and/or text and you link directly to us. By the way, this means that you can't 
							sell ads, barter for stuff, offer your services, or otherwise earn money, 
							ROBLOX' Items, or ROBLOX Points either on web pages that contain our pictures 
							and other Materials, or by using our pictures or other Materials, such as by 
							offering to make ROBLOX banners or backgrounds for others.

								or asks for your password or personal information (such as your name, address 
								or phone number), please let us know immediately at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060617221316/mailto:info@roblox.com">
